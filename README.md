# Dead Forest Burning



**Title:** Dead Forests Burning

**Group Members:**

- Michael Cook
- Dominique Bachelet
- Anna Talucci

**Description:**

This is a web map of lodgepole pine forest in transition with an overview of outbreak severity, burn severity, and forest recovery for a section of the landscape in central interior British Columbia. Forests have experienced unprecedented mortality from the recent mountain pine beetle outbreak and subsequently burned during wildfire. Land managers have been concerned about dead forest conditions and the influence dead forests may have on fire behavior and forest resiliency. This project is an overview
of a large dissertation project. The composition of this site serves as a final project for class:
Geovisualization provided by Oregon State University.

**Goal:**







**Technical summary:**

- In this repository there is an image file with a sample of photos
- Aerial video footage might be available
- Some field data could potentially be integrated
- Remote sensing analysis from google earth engine platform (see file GEE_sample)
- Spatial data could include: fire perimeters, provincial park boundaries, biogeoclimatic zones, tree species (spatial data file only includes fire perimeters for now)

### Design Scheme

#### Layout

We used a story map layout



#### Color Scheme

We generated out color scheme using a photograph in coolors.co

 

![image color](N:/geog4572.proposal.taluccia/images/coolorsimage.PNG)







Then used coolors.com.
